/**
 * Custom shadow node for [BpkRatingViewManager].
 *
 * This class will measure to the same size as the current [RNBpkRating] being rendered.
 * To approach used here is based on the code for react native's EditText and CheckBox components.
 *
 * A high level overview of what is happening is as follows:
 *
 * 1. [BpkRatingViewManager] will receive props from js code, update [RNBpkRating] instance and
 *   call [RNBpkRating.render] after the all props have been updated
 *
 * 2. [RNBpkRating.render] will create an instance of [BpkRatingLocalData] containing the information
 *   to create a copy of the current [RNBpkRating] being rendered. RNBpkRating will then call
 *   UIManagerModule.setViewLocalData which will trigger [BpkRatingShadowNode.setLocalData]
 *
 * 3. [BpkRatingShadowNode.setLocalData] will mark this node as dirty which will cause
 *   [BpkRatingShadowNode.measure] to be called in next layout pass.
 *
 * 4. [BpkRatingShadowNode.measure] will use the [BpkRatingLocalData] to create a copy of the current
 *   view being rendered and measure itself.
