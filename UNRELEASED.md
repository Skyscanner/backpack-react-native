  - Added theming support to `BpkChip` when selected. See https://backpack.github.io/components/chip?platform=native#theme-props

**Changed**

- react-native-bpk-component-select:
  - `BpkSelect` with `valid={true}` no longer has a green border to match the behaviour of `BpkTextInput` which also doesn't have one.
